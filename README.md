## 🚀 What is AarogyaX?  

Healthcare shouldn’t be limited by geography. AarogyaX allows patients to:  
- 📅 Book online appointments with doctors.  
- 🎥 Consult via **secure video calls** powered by **WebRTC**.  
- 📂 Access electronic health records stored safely in **Postgres/SQLite**.  
- 💊 Get real-time updates on prescriptions and treatment plans.  

Doctors, on the other hand, can:  
- 👨‍⚕️ Manage their patients with ease.  
- 📊 Access patient data via a clean dashboard.  
- ✍️ Prescribe and update medication remotely.

## 💡 How it will be used  

1. **Patients** sign up via the mobile app (built in **React Native + Expo**).  
2. They can search and book doctors, initiate **video calls**, and chat securely.  
3. **Doctors** log in, accept or decline appointments, and consult patients virtually.  
4. **Medical records** are managed via **Postgres (production)** and **SQLite (local/dev)** with **Prisma ORM** making data flow smooth and reliable.  

The end goal: *Bring medical care closer, faster, and smarter.*
